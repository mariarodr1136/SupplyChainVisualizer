# Nexus: Supply Chain Visualizer

[![CI](https://github.com/mariarodr1136/SupplyChainVisualizer/actions/workflows/ci.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/mariarodr1136/SupplyChainVisualizer/actions/workflows/ci.yml) ![React](https://img.shields.io/badge/React-18-61DAFB) ![Java](https://img.shields.io/badge/Java-17-007396) ![Spring Boot](https://img.shields.io/badge/Spring%20Boot-3.5-6DB33F) ![PostgreSQL](https://img.shields.io/badge/PostgreSQL-Database-336791) ![Docker](https://img.shields.io/badge/Docker-Containerized-2496ED) ![Render](https://img.shields.io/badge/Render-Deployed-46E3B7)

A full-stack web application for mapping and analyzing supply chain networks — interactive geospatial maps, live inventory and shipment tracking, and analytics computed from real operational data. Businesses can visualize their entire network on a map, monitor stock levels and deliveries in real time, and surface bottlenecks through KPIs, forecasts, and a live alerts feed.

Built end-to-end with a **React 18** frontend and a **Spring Boot 3.5 / Java 17** REST API, secured with stateless **JWT** authentication, backed by **PostgreSQL** with versioned **Flyway** migrations, covered by CI-run test suites on both tiers, and deployed with **Docker** on **Render** via Infrastructure as Code.

Live Demo:[supply-chain-visualizer.onrender.com](https://supply-chain-visualizer.onrender.com)

> Hosted on Render's free tier — the backend may take 1–2 minutes to wake on first visit.

### Features

- **Interactive Supply Chain Map** — facility nodes and transport connections on Leaflet with performance overlays
- **Inventory Dashboard** — stock levels by location with critical/low/optimal/excess thresholds
- **Shipment Tracker** — status transitions with automatic inventory adjustment on delivery
- **Analytics Workspace** — on-time rate, average lead time, exception rate, SLA by lane, and lead-time variance computed from live shipment data
- **Forecasting Suite** — demand forecasts, seasonality signals, and safety stock guidance from real inventory levels
- **Live Alerts Feed** — auto-refreshing feed of delayed shipments and low-stock alerts
- **Orders Hub & Network Connections** — order lifecycle visibility and transport link management
- **Guest Mode** — one-click, read-only demo backed by an in-memory dataset; changes reset on refresh
- **Polished dark UI** — custom dark theme across dashboards, modals, and map tiles, designed for long-session readability

### Engineering Highlights

- **Layered backend architecture** — controllers, DTOs, service interfaces with implementations, and JPA repositories, plus a global exception handler for consistent API errors
- **Stateless security** — Spring Security + JWT with token generation, validation, and role-based access; secrets injected via environment variables, never committed
- **Guest mode without a backend** — the frontend service layer transparently falls back to a static in-memory dataset, so the demo works instantly even while the free-tier server cold-starts
- **Database as code** — Flyway versioned migrations create the schema and idempotent seed data automatically on startup, across three runtime profiles (local PostgreSQL, embedded H2 demo, managed Postgres in production)
- **Automated quality gates** — 57 backend unit tests plus frontend Vitest suites run in GitHub Actions on every push
- **Reproducible deployment** — multi-stage Docker builds, a one-command local stack via Docker Compose, and a Render Blueprint that provisions the entire cloud environment in one click

### Quick Start

With Docker, one command runs the full stack (PostgreSQL + API + frontend):

```bash
git clone https://github.com/mariarodr1136/SupplyChainVisualizer.git
cd SupplyChainVisualizer
docker-compose up -d
# Frontend: http://localhost:3000 | API: http://localhost:8080 | Swagger: http://localhost:8080/swagger-ui.html
```

<details>
<summary><b>Manual setup (without Docker)</b></summary>

**Prerequisites:** Node.js 18+, Java 17+ with Maven, PostgreSQL

```bash
# Backend — Flyway creates the schema and seed data automatically
createdb supply_chain_db
cd backend/supply-chain-visualizer
mvn spring-boot:run          # http://localhost:8080

# Frontend (in a second terminal)
cd frontend
npm install
npm start                    # http://localhost:3000
```

Database credentials are configured in `backend/supply-chain-visualizer/src/main/resources/application.properties`.

### Architecture

```
frontend/                      # React SPA (Vite) — components, pages, services with guest-mode fallback
backend/supply-chain-visualizer/
  └── src/main/java/           # Controllers → Services → JPA Repositories, JWT security, OpenAPI config
  └── src/main/resources/      # Profile-based config + Flyway migrations (schema + seed)
.github/workflows/ci.yml       # Backend + frontend test suites on every push
docker-compose.yml             # Local full stack
render.yaml                    # Render Blueprint (Infrastructure as Code)
```

- **REST API** with resource-first endpoints for nodes, connections, inventory, shipments, products, and analytics
- **Stateless JWT authentication** via Spring Security; no secrets in source — all sensitive config comes from environment variables
- **Interactive API docs**: Swagger UI at [`/swagger-ui.html`](http://localhost:8080/swagger-ui.html) with JWT bearer auth support (raw OpenAPI spec at `/v3/api-docs`)

<summary><b>A note on demo data</b></summary>

Registered accounts share a single demo workspace — nodes, shipments, and inventory are common to all users, which keeps the live demo populated and interactive. Because the live demo runs on an embedded database, shared data may reset when the service is redeployed. Guest mode is fully isolated: it runs on an in-memory dataset in the browser and resets on refresh.

### Testing

**57 backend unit tests** (JUnit 5, Mockito, AssertJ) cover the service and security layers — CRUD and filtering, inventory thresholds, shipment status transitions, analytics KPI calculations, and JWT generation/validation. The frontend uses **Vitest + React Testing Library** for service-layer and component tests. Both suites run in **GitHub Actions CI** on every push.

```bash
cd backend/supply-chain-visualizer && mvn test   # backend
cd frontend && npm test                          # frontend
```

<details>
<summary><b>Backend test coverage by class</b></summary>

| Test Class | Coverage |
|---|---|
| `NodeServiceImplTest` | CRUD ops, filter by type/status — 11 tests |
| `ProductServiceImplTest` | CRUD ops, filter by status, lookup by SKU — 12 tests |
| `InventoryServiceImplTest` | CRUD ops, status thresholds (critical/low/optimal/excess) — 11 tests |
| `ShipmentServiceImplTest` | Status transitions, inventory adjustment on delivery — 8 tests |
| `AnalyticsServiceImplTest` | On-time rate, exception rate, avg lead time, SLA by lane, lead-time variance — 8 tests |
| `JwtUtilsTest` | Token generation, username extraction, validation (valid/expired/malformed) — 7 tests |

</details>

### Deployment

Deployed on **Render** via a one-click Blueprint (`render.yaml`):

- **Backend** — Dockerized Spring Boot API (multi-stage Maven → JRE build) running as a web service; the free-tier demo persists to embedded H2, and switching the profile to `render` with an attached database runs it against managed PostgreSQL (`entrypoint.sh` parses Render's connection string into JDBC components automatically)
- **Frontend** — React production build served as a static site with client-side routing support
- **Configuration** — JWT secrets, CORS origins, and database credentials all come from environment variables

To deploy your own instance: fork the repo, create a new Blueprint in the [Render Dashboard](https://dashboard.render.com) (it auto-detects `render.yaml`), and update the CORS/API URL environment variables after provisioning.
